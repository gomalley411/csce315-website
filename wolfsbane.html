    <p>Wolfsbane potion may seem medieval at first, and to some it may seem like it's not even real. The potion's name was based off
        of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series, in which Professor Lupin must drink the potion before the full moon every month. The Wolfsbane
        Potion actually doesn't stop a werewolf's transformation, but rather it allows a werewolf to "keep his mind" while transformed,
        so he doesn't go around attacking anyone.<br>Of course, since magic is involved here, we can't just assume the potion will
        actually <i>work</i> 100% of the time. You can read more about our contingency plans, made with the cooperation of US government
        scientists, <a href="ourplan.html">here</a>.</p>
