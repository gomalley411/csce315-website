    <p><b>This section discusses what will happen if an outbreak occurs and the amount of werewolves needs to be controlled.</b>
    Internally we discussed several potential solutions to help with the problem, including the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>billboards along major interstate and local highways, that inform the public about important information such as when
            werewolves are expected to transform</li>
        <li>concocting the Wolfsbane Potion from the <i>Harry Potter</i> series (see <a href="wolfsbane.html">here</a>) to help prevent
            werewolf attacks, and </li>
        <li>modifying existing police and military systems to prepare for the worst.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>Ultimately we decided to mostly focus on the latter option, but have decided on keeping the other two ideas
        as well. Here's what you need to know:<br></p>
    <div class="explanation">
        <p>We have organized an elite team to help work with government scientists to help prepare for the worst possible outcome,
        which is if an army of werewolves tries to take over the world. Werewolves are weak to silver bullets, so weâ€™d make
        some modifications to our police and military weapons systems to include silver bul-lets in their arsenals, modifying
        the necessary technology and computer as needed, either in Java or C++. Automated guns would use motion tracking and
        cameras, so we would need someone on our side who knows how to code for those as well.</p>
